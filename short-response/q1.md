# Question

When should Context be used?

# Answer

Context should be used in React when you need to share state or data across multiple components without having to pass props down manually at every level. It is particularly useful for:

Global State Management: When you have data that needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels.
Theming: To provide a consistent theme (like colors, fonts) across your application.
User Authentication: To manage and provide user authentication status and user information throughout the app.
Configuration Settings: To share configuration settings or environment variables across components.
