# Question

What are the steps to incorporating context into your application?

# Answer
To incorporate context into your React application, follow these steps:


Create a Context:
    Use React.createContext() to create a context object.

Provide the Context:
    Use a Context Provider to wrap the part of your component tree that needs access to the context. The Provider component accepts a value prop to pass the current context value.

Consume the Context:
    Use the useContext hook in functional components or Context.Consumer in class components to access the context value.
